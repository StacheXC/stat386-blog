Exploratory data analysis is a critical component of the data science process. It can't be understated just how helpful it is to understand a data set before you dive right into fitting a model. In this blog post, I will be analyzing a data set containing information about every Pokemon move from the mainline games. I will be pointing out interesting details (through tables and graphs) about the variables involved as well as the relationships between them.

# The Data Set

This data set was compiled from the moves endpoint of the [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/docs/v2). There are several move attributes included, but I chose the 6 attributes I found most interesting/important. Here are the first few rows of the data set after pulling all the necessary info from the api and selecting certain columns.

```python
moves.head()
```

| name        |   power |   accuracy |   pp | damage class   | type     | target           |
|:------------|--------:|-----------:|-----:|:---------------|:---------|:-----------------|
| pound       |      40 |        100 |   35 | physical       | normal   | selected-pokemon |
| karate-chop |      50 |        100 |   25 | physical       | fighting | selected-pokemon |
| double-slap |      15 |         85 |   10 | physical       | normal   | selected-pokemon |
| comet-punch |      18 |         85 |   15 | physical       | normal   | selected-pokemon |
| mega-punch  |      80 |         85 |   20 | physical       | normal   | selected-pokemon |

There are a total of 919 observations with 3 numerical features and 3 categorical ones. I'll go over each of them briefly.

- name: A unique name for each move, can serve as an id
- power: Determines how much damage the move will do to the opponent
- accuracy: How likely the move is to make contact with the opponent (the success rate)
- pp: How many times the move can be used
- damage class: Whether the move deals physical damage (a punch), special damage (a spell), or inflict some kind of status condition (sleep)
- type: What kind of elemental type the move is (grass, fire, water, etc.)
- target: Whether a move targets a single opponent, multiple opponents simultaneously, an ally, or the user

By exploring this data set, I intend to answer the following questions:

- What is the meaning of the missing (nan) values?
- What are the distributions of the variables?
- How do these features interact with each other?

# Understanding the Missing values

The only features of this data set that contain missing values are accuracy and power. These values are not listed as NA's due to the data set being incomplete however. Having some prior knowledge about the games can enable one to understand the meaning of the NA's. Let's first look at the accuracy variable.

```python
moves[moves["accuracy"].isna()][["name", "accuracy", "target"]].head(n = 10)
```

| name         |   accuracy | target           |
|:-------------|-----------:|:-----------------|
| swords-dance |        nan | user             |
| whirlwind    |        nan | selected-pokemon |
| roar         |        nan | selected-pokemon |
| mist         |        nan | users-field      |
| growth       |        nan | user             |
| meditate     |        nan | user             |
| agility      |        nan | user             |
| teleport     |        nan | user             |
| mimic        |        nan | selected-pokemon |
| double-team  |        nan | user             |

By filtering out all the non-missing values, we can see a pattern that most moves with the accuracy missing either target the the user or the field. These are moves that boost the user or change the environment in some way, not ones that throw something at the opponent. With that context, it makes sense why the accuracy isn't given a number. Furthermore, the accuracy being listed as NA actually conveys this information. The exeception to the rule is moves like whirlwind, which are attacks that target the opponent, but have perfect accuracy. The difference between perfect accuracy and 100% accuracy requires prior knowledge, but to keep things concise, moves with perfect accuracy won't miss even when the user's accuracy is meddled with.

```python
moves[moves["power"].isna()][["name", "power", "damage class"]].head(n = 10)
```

| name         |   power | damage class   |
|:-------------|--------:|:---------------|
| guillotine   |     nan | physical       |
| swords-dance |     nan | status         |
| whirlwind    |     nan | status         |
| sand-attack  |     nan | status         |
| horn-drill   |     nan | physical       |
| tail-whip    |     nan | status         |
| leer         |     nan | status         |
| growl        |     nan | status         |
| roar         |     nan | status         |
| sing         |     nan | status         |

As for power, the pattern that jumps out (especially if you've played the games before) is that most moves with missing values are status moves. Since status moves don't deal damage, it makes sense that these moves are missing power values. It might make sense to replace these NA's with 0's. There are some moves shown that aren't status moves (guillotine, horn drill), and these are known as one-hit-KO moves. These moves knock out the opponent in one hit, and therefore have infinite power.

# Distributions of Variables

Now that we understand the meanings of the NA's, let's take a look at the distributions of some of our numerical variables and some of our categorical ones.

```python
sns.histplot(data = moves, x = "power")
plt.show()
```

![Figure]({{site.url}}/{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/power_distribution.png)

The distribution of the power of moves seemes to be roughly symmetrical (maybe right-skewed due to a few high outliers). The outliers influence the mean, causing it to rise above the median, as shown in the summary table below.

```python
moves["power"].describe()
```

|       |    power |
|:------|---------:|
| count | 588      |
| mean  |  77.4541 |
| std   |  40.9561 |
| min   |   0      |
| 25%   |  50      |
| 50%   |  80      |
| 75%   | 100      |
| max   | 250      |

```python
sns.boxplot(data = moves, x = "accuracy")
plt.show()
```

![Figure]({{site.url}}/{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/accuracy_distribution.png)

The distribution of accuracy is way different than that of power. The values for accuracy are heavily concentrated at the high end with many low outliers. The fact that the accuracy is capped at 100% means that this distribution is very susceptible to being left-skewed. According to the summary below, the mean it pulled down as a result of the low outliers.

```python
moves["accuracy"].describe()
```

|       |   accuracy |
|:------|-----------:|
| count |   634      |
| mean  |    95.1183 |
| std   |    11.5754 |
| min   |     0      |
| 25%   |    95      |
| 50%   |   100      |
| 75%   |   100      |
| max   |   100      |

```python
sns.countplot(data = moves, x = "damage class")
plt.show()
```

![Figure]({{site.url}}/{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/damage_class_distribution.png)

According to this plot, the most popular damage class by far is physical. This is likely a result of how moves were classified before 2006. Before the "physical special split", the damage classes of moves that dealt damage (ignoring status moves) were determined by their type. All grass, fire, water, electric, dark, psychic, and dragon moves were special, and the rest (the 10 other types) were physical. The fact that the majority of types back then were "physical" types could be the reason why physical is the most common damage class.

```python
moves.groupby("type").size().sort_values()
```

| type        |   0 |
|:------------|----:|
| rock        |  26 |
| dragon      |  31 |
| ground      |  31 |
| flying      |  31 |
| ice         |  33 |
| fairy       |  33 |
| bug         |  34 |
| ghost       |  34 |
| poison      |  36 |
| steel       |  38 |
| fire        |  47 |
| electric    |  49 |
| water       |  49 |
| dark        |  52 |
| fighting    |  57 |
| grass       |  59 |
| psychic     |  79 |
| normal      | 200 |

There are a few interesting things about this table that counts each move type. The first is that Gamefreak (the company that makes the games) loves normal type moves. On the other hand, dragon isn't a very popular type for moves, probably because dragon type pokemon are rare (as they should). The fairy type is fairly low on the list since it is the newest type, being introduced in 2013. It is surprising that dark is so high on the list, given that it was introduced one generation (a few years) after all the other types.

# Relationships Between Variables

The last part of this analysis will cover interesting relationships I discovered between the variables. This is the most fun part of the analysis.

```python
moves.groupby("type").agg({"accuracy": "median"}).sort_values(by = "accuracy").head()
```

| type    |   accuracy |
|:--------|-----------:|
| rock    |       92.5 |
| ice     |       95   |
| bug     |      100   |
| psychic |      100   |
| poison  |      100   |

Anyone who has ever played the games knows that no rock move has perfect accuracy. The data enforces this reputation, as the rock type is one of the only two types that doesn't have a 100% median accuracy.

```python
sns.scatterplot(data = moves, x = "power", y = "pp")
plt.show()
```

![Figure]({{site.url}}/{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/powerpp.png)

This scatterplot demonstrates negative, maybe non-linear correlation between power and pp (the number of times a move can be used). This makes sense, as the more powerful a move is, the more restricted its usage should be (from a game balancing perspective). The correlation between these two variables is calculated below, and it is quite strong given that this is actual data and not something that was generated for a homework problem.

```python
moves[["power", "pp"]].corr()
```

|       |     power |        pp |
|:------|----------:|----------:|
| power |  1        | -0.514725 |
| pp    | -0.514725 |  1        |

```python
sns.countplot(data = moves[moves["damage class"] != "status"], y = "type", hue = "damage class")
plt.show()
```

![Figure]({{site.url}}/{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/typeclass.png)

The last interesting relationship I discovered was between damage class and type. Remember the "physical special split" I mentioned earlier? It is on full display in this graph. Most move types that were classified as special before 2006 are still dominated by mostly special moves. The same goes for move types that were once classified as physical. The biggest disruptor to this pattern has to be the dark type. Even though all damage-dealing dark type moves before 2006 were special moves, the overwhelming majority of dark type moves nowadays are physical.
