Exploratory data analysis is a critical component of the data science process. It can't be understated just how helpful it is to understand a data set before you dive right into fitting a model. In this blog post, I will be analyzing a data set containing information about every Pokemon move from the mainline games. I will be pointing out interesting details (through tables and graphs) about the variables involved as well as the relationships between them.

# The Data Set

This data set was compiled from the moves endpoint of the [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/docs/v2). There are several move attributes included, but I chose the 9 attributes I found most interesting/important. Here is what the data set looked like after pulling all the necessary info from the api and selecting certain columns.

| name        |   accuracy |   effect_chance |   pp |   priority |   power | damage_class.name   | generation.name   | target.name      | type.name   |
|:------------|-----------:|----------------:|-----:|-----------:|--------:|:--------------------|:------------------|:-----------------|:------------|
|pound        |        100 |             nan |   35 |          0 |      40 | physical            | generation-i      | selected-pokemon | normal      |
|karate-chop  |        100 |             nan |   25 |          0 |      50 | physical            | generation-i      | selected-pokemon | fighting    |
|double-slap  |         85 |             nan |   10 |          0 |      15 | physical            | generation-i      | selected-pokemon | normal      |
|comet-punch  |         85 |             nan |   15 |          0 |      18 | physical            | generation-i      | selected-pokemon | normal      |
|mega-punch   |         85 |             nan |   20 |          0 |      80 | physical            | generation-i      | selected-pokemon | normal      |

There are a total of 919 observations with 5 numerical features and 4 categorical ones. I'll go over each of them briefly.

- name: A unique name for each move, can serve as an id
- accuracy: How likely the move is to make contact with the opponent (the success rate)
- effect_chance: How likely the move is to apply a secondary bonus effect
- pp: How many times the move can be used
- priority: Moves with higher priority will go before moves with lower priority
- power: Determines how much damage the move will do to the opponent
- damage_class.name: Whether the move deals physical damage, special damage, or inflict some kind of status condition
- generation.name: Which generation of games was the move introduced
- target.name: Whether a move targets a single opponent, multiple opponents simultaneously, an ally, or the user
- type.name: What kind of elemental type the move is (grass, fire, water, etc.)
